CV Online
Implement an online CV

The site  will consists of 2 parts:

user area
As a user I can view the CV and also be able to download it.
admin area
This page is protected by a login
From here  I can add multiple languages and add translation for each language
From here I can also change the text that is displayed on the page
Structure for page (minimum requirements):

Page:
header 
biography
portfolio
contact form
footer
At least 3 different animations are used
The user can change the theme: dark vs light
The user can change the language: at least en and ro
It will be responsive at least on mobile.


Recommendation:

Text that will be translated based on language should come via an api call

 Nice to have:

Use Angular
Allow admins to create dynamic content:
Use a text area to capture the html text on the admin area
Use that html and injected in the page. E.g. below the portfolio section
Allow the admin to define a color system from the admin page
To keep a history of changes
Maybe an rollback mechanism to a previous version
